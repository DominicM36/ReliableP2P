Test P2P server using code from https://github.com/Ezi0aaudit0re/P2P-music-sharing

Protocol Keys:
    connect: this is sent when a new node has entered the       
        network. When the database server receives a message containing connect, it knows to send out the peer list so that the new peer knows all the peers in the network.
